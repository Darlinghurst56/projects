# Task ID: 13
# Title: Investigate and Fix Agent Task Widget TaskMaster Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Debug and fix the task assignment widget to display real TaskMaster data instead of placeholder content. The widget should show all 63 tasks from 5 contexts retrieved from the TaskMaster API integration.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
1. Debug TaskMaster API Integration:
   - Inspect network requests to verify API calls to TaskMaster are being made correctly
   - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors related to data fetching
   - Verify the API endpoint URLs and authentication are properly configured
   - Examine the response data structure from TaskMaster API

2. Analyze Widget Data Loading:
   - Review task-assignment.js to understand current data loading implementation
   - Check if the widget is properly subscribing to TaskMaster data events
   - Verify data transformation logic between API response and widget display format
   - Ensure proper error handling for failed API requests

3. Fix Data Display Issues:
   - Update the widget's render methods to use real TaskMaster data
   - Replace placeholder content with dynamic data binding
   - Implement proper data mapping for all 5 contexts (frontend-architect, ui-developer, integration-specialist, qa-specialist, server-agent)
   - Ensure all 63 tasks are properly displayed with their status, priority, and assignment information

4. Implement Proper State Management:
   - Ensure widget state updates when TaskMaster data changes
   - Add loading states while fetching data
   - Implement error states for failed data loads
   - Add refresh functionality to manually reload TaskMaster data

5. Test Integration:
   - Verify widget displays correct task counts for each context
   - Ensure task filtering by context works properly
   - Test task assignment functionality with real TaskMaster data
   - Validate that task status updates are reflected in the widget

# Test Strategy:
1. API Integration Testing:
   - Open browser developer tools and monitor network tab
   - Verify TaskMaster API calls return 200 status with valid JSON data
   - Confirm the response contains all 63 tasks across 5 contexts
   - Check for any CORS issues or authentication failures

2. Widget Functionality Testing:
   - Load the dashboard and navigate to the task assignment widget
   - Verify the widget displays real task titles, not placeholder text
   - Confirm task counts match the actual TaskMaster data (63 total tasks)
   - Test filtering by each of the 5 contexts

3. Data Accuracy Testing:
   - Cross-reference displayed tasks with TaskMaster source data
   - Verify task properties (status, priority, dependencies) are correctly shown
   - Test that clicking on tasks shows accurate detailed information
   - Ensure task assignment operations update the TaskMaster backend

4. Error Handling Testing:
   - Temporarily disable network to test offline behavior
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed
   - Test the widget's recovery when connection is restored
   - Ensure no JavaScript errors appear in the console

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure widget load time with full TaskMaster data
   - Verify smooth scrolling and interaction with 63 tasks
   - Test memory usage doesn't increase over time
   - Ensure widget remains responsive during data updates
