# Task ID: 8
# Title: Install HTTP/Fetch MCP server for enhanced API integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Install and configure the HTTP/Fetch MCP server to provide enhanced API calling capabilities with caching, error handling, and reusable client configurations for improved API integration across the project.
# Details:
1. Install HTTP/Fetch MCP server using npm: `npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-http` or similar package
2. Add HTTP MCP server configuration to .mcp.json file with appropriate server settings
3. Configure default headers, timeout settings, and base URLs for common API endpoints
4. Set up caching configuration with TTL settings for different API response types
5. Implement error handling strategies including retry logic and fallback mechanisms
6. Create reusable API client configurations for weather, news, and other external services
7. Test HTTP client functionality with various API endpoints
8. Document HTTP MCP server capabilities and usage patterns for team reference
9. Ensure proper environment variable handling for API keys and sensitive configuration

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify MCP server installation and connection in Claude Code
2. Test basic HTTP GET/POST requests to public APIs
3. Validate caching functionality by making repeated requests and confirming cached responses
4. Test error handling with invalid URLs and timeout scenarios
5. Verify authentication header handling with API key-protected endpoints
6. Test concurrent request handling and rate limiting
7. Confirm proper JSON parsing and response formatting
8. Validate environment variable loading for API credentials
9. Test integration with existing dashboard widgets that require API data

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install HTTP/Fetch MCP Server Package [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the necessary HTTP/Fetch MCP server package and its dependencies.
### Details:
Use package manager (e.g., npm, pip) to install the HTTP/Fetch MCP server package. Verify successful installation by checking the installed version.

STARTING INSTALLATION: Found excellent third-party HTTP MCP server option: zcaceres/fetch-mcp. This provides flexible HTTP fetching with multiple output formats (HTML, JSON, text, Markdown). Will install this package instead of the non-existent @modelcontextprotocol/server-http.

## 2. Configure Server with Default Settings [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Configure the MCP server using the .mcp.json file with default settings.
### Details:
Create or modify the .mcp.json file to include basic server configurations such as port number, host address, and default route settings. Ensure the server starts without errors using these default settings.
<info added on 2025-07-04T19:34:28.762Z>
CONFIGURATION COMPLETED: Successfully configured fetch-mcp server in .mcp.json with absolute path to built distribution. Created comprehensive HTTP client configuration files:

1. /config/http-client.json - Complete configuration with caching, error handling, API client definitions, rate limiting, and security settings
2. /config/http-client.js - JavaScript module providing HttpClient class with advanced features like retry logic, caching, authentication, and request/response handling

Configuration includes:
- Default timeout: 30 seconds
- Retry attempts: 3 with exponential backoff
- Caching with configurable TTL
- Rate limiting per domain
- Security domain validation
- Support for multiple API clients (weather, news, testing endpoints)
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## 3. Set Up Caching and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement caching strategies and error handling mechanisms for the MCP server.
### Details:
Configure caching mechanisms (e.g., in-memory, Redis) to improve performance. Implement error handling to gracefully manage exceptions and return appropriate error responses.

## 4. Create Reusable API Client Configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop reusable API client configurations for interacting with various services.
### Details:
Define configurations for API clients, including base URLs, authentication details, and request/response transformers. Ensure these configurations can be easily reused across different services.

Assigned to integration-specialist. Status: in-progress. Priority: medium. Complexity: 6/10.

Analysis: This task involves creating reusable API client configurations for the dashboard system. Based on existing codebase analysis, this likely relates to:

1. Control D API client configurations
2. TaskMaster HTTP API client setup
3. Authentication and rate limiting configurations
4. Error handling and retry logic
5. Mock/fallback configurations for development

Approach:
1. Examine existing API clients in the codebase
2. Identify common configuration patterns
3. Create reusable configuration templates
4. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
5. Add mock/development configurations
6. Test API client functionality

Dependencies:
- Dependent on Task 8.3 completion
- Integration with existing dashboard widgets
- Authentication system integration

Starting analysis of current API client implementations.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: Reusable API Client Configurations

✅ Created comprehensive API configuration system:

1. **api-client-config.js** - Core configuration templates:
   - BaseConfig with common settings (timeout, retries, caching, rate limiting)
   - ControlDConfig for DNS management APIs  
   - TaskMasterConfig for task coordination
   - AgentCoordinationConfig for multi-agent systems
   - ExternalAPIsConfig for third-party integrations
   - ConfiguredAPIClient class with full feature support

2. **api-utils.js** - Utility classes and convenience methods:
   - DashboardAPIClients with pre-configured clients
   - ConfigManager for custom configurations
   - APIErrorHandler for centralized error handling
   - Health check and bulk data operations

3. **api-integration-examples.js** - Usage examples:
   - 8 comprehensive examples covering all API types
   - Widget integration patterns
   - Error handling setup
   - System health monitoring
   - Bulk data operations

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Created test-api-client-integration.html for comprehensive testing
   - Updated dns-status widget to use new API configuration system
   - Backward compatibility with existing implementations
   - Global access patterns for non-module environments

Features implemented:
✅ Standardized configuration templates
✅ Rate limiting and caching
✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff  
✅ Authentication handling (Bearer, API key, session)
✅ Mock data support for development
✅ Error handling and logging
✅ Health monitoring capabilities
✅ CORS handling for external APIs
✅ Cache management with TTL
✅ Widget integration patterns

The system provides a unified API client architecture that all dashboard widgets can use, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
