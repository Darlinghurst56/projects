# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix critical issues in the DNS Analytics Widget identified during QA testing, including dependency problems, UI element errors, data loading failures, and integration issues.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: DNS Analytics Widget System
# Details:
1. **EventBus Dependency:** Resolve the missing EventBus dependency to ensure the widget initializes correctly and can communicate with other dashboard components.
2. **DOM Element Fixes:** Ensure all key UI elements (#total-queries, #blocked-queries, etc.) are properly created and accessible within the DOM.
3. **Data Loading Implementation:** Implement a robust data loading mechanism to fetch and display DNS analytics data correctly.
4. **Time Range Controls:** Implement functional time range controls, ensuring buttons and selection mechanisms work as expected.
5. **Error Handling:** Fix error handling methods, ensuring the `showError` method is accessible and functions correctly to display error messages.
6. **User Interactions:** Enable all user interactions within the widget, ensuring interactive elements respond appropriately to user actions.
7. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the widget adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
8. **Dashboard Integration:** Integrate the widget properly with the dashboard system, ensuring seamless communication and data exchange.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Initial Load Test:** Verify that the widget loads without errors and displays initial data after the fixes are applied.
2. **Functional Testing:** Test all interactive elements, such as filters, time range controls, and drill-down options, to ensure they function correctly.
3. **Data Accuracy:** Verify that the data displayed in the widget is accurate and up-to-date.
4. **Responsive Design Validation:** Test the widget on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts correctly and maintains usability.
5. **Error Handling Verification:** Simulate error conditions and verify that the widget displays appropriate error messages.
6. **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the widget integrates seamlessly with the dashboard system and communicates correctly with other components.
