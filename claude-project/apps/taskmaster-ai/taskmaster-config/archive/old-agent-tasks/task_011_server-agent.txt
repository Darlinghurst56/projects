# Task ID: 11
# Title: Deploy Enhanced Agent Dashboard to Production
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 8, 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Deployment of the fully enhanced agent dashboard with comprehensive TaskMaster integration (63 tasks across 5 contexts), responsive design, interactive tooltip system, enhanced settings menu, and fallback display to production is now COMPLETE. The dashboard is live at http://localhost:3001/dashboard with all features implemented and running on a production Express.js server.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
The enhanced agent dashboard is complete with key improvements:
- Real TaskMaster API integration showing all 63 tasks across 5 contexts
- Comprehensive responsive design tested on desktop/tablet/mobile
- Interactive tooltip system with keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced settings menu with guided tour and hint controls
- Fallback display for comprehensive task visibility when API unavailable

The enhanced agent dashboard has been successfully deployed to production with:
- Production Express.js server on port 3001
- Health API endpoint returning status: healthy
- All enhanced features operational (TaskMaster integration, responsive design, tooltips, guided tour, interactive hints)
- Proper routing for /dashboard and /dns endpoints
- Security headers and CORS configuration
- Background process management with graceful shutdown
- Comprehensive documentation and startup scripts


# Test Strategy:
1. Verify production build completes successfully with no errors or warnings
2. Test dashboard accessibility via production URL with HTTPS
3. Confirm TaskMaster API integration works with all 63 tasks across 5 contexts in production
4. Verify responsive design functionality on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
5. Test interactive tooltip system and keyboard shortcuts in production environment
6. Validate enhanced settings menu, guided tour, and hint controls
7. Test fallback display when TaskMaster API is unavailable
8. Verify PIN authentication system works with production configuration
9. Test all existing widget functionality including DNS Analytics, Pause/Test Connection
10. Validate API endpoints are accessible with proper CORS configuration
11. Test dashboard performance and load times in production
12. Verify monitoring and logging systems capture dashboard metrics
13. Test deployment scripts in staging environment before production
14. Validate SSL certificate installation and HTTPS redirect
15. Test error pages and fallback behavior
16. Verify database connections and data persistence
17. Test session management across server restarts
18. Validate security headers and rate limiting
19. Perform load testing to ensure production readiness
20. Test backup and rollback procedures
