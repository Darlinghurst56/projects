# Task ID: 9
# Title: Fix Puppeteer Browser Launch Configuration in MCP Server
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve the 'Dangerous browser arguments detected: --no-sandbox' error in the MCP Puppeteer server by implementing proper browser launch configuration that works with the security restrictions, specifically addressing ARM64 architecture requirements, while enabling UI testing capabilities.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
1. **Investigate Current Configuration:** Examine the MCP Puppeteer server implementation to understand the current browser launch parameters and security restrictions causing the '--no-sandbox' error, paying close attention to ARM64-specific configurations.

2. **Research Previous Puppeteer Solutions:** Search through existing tasks and codebase for any previous Puppeteer configurations or workarounds that successfully handled similar security restrictions, with a focus on ARM64 architecture and '--no-sandbox' issues.

3. **Implement Safe Browser Launch Configuration:** Create a configuration that avoids dangerous arguments while maintaining functionality:
   - Remove '--no-sandbox' from default arguments
   - Use alternative arguments like '--disable-setuid-sandbox' if needed
   - Implement proper headless mode configuration
   - Set up appropriate viewport and user agent settings
   - Ensure compatibility with ARM64 architecture, potentially requiring specific Chrome/Chromium binaries.

4. **Handle allowDangerous Parameter:** Fix the implementation of the allowDangerous parameter to properly bypass security checks when explicitly set to true:
   - Validate the parameter is being passed correctly through the MCP protocol
   - Ensure the security check logic properly evaluates this flag
   - Add appropriate warnings when dangerous mode is enabled

5. **Create Fallback Configuration:** Implement a fallback browser configuration for restricted environments:
   - Detect when running in Docker, WSL, or ARM64 environments
   - Provide environment-specific launch arguments, including ARM64-specific arguments if necessary.
   - Document requirements for different execution contexts

6. **Update Error Handling:** Improve error messages to provide clearer guidance:
   - Include specific instructions for different environments, including ARM64.
   - Suggest appropriate launch configurations based on the error
   - Add troubleshooting documentation

7. **Test Integration with Dashboard:** Ensure the fixed Puppeteer configuration works with existing dashboard testing workflows:
   - Verify navigation to dashboard URLs works correctly
   - Test screenshot functionality
   - Validate element interaction capabilities

# Test Strategy:
1. **Basic Launch Test:** Verify that the Puppeteer browser can launch successfully without the '--no-sandbox' error in the default configuration, specifically on ARM64 architecture.

2. **AllowDangerous Parameter Test:** Test that setting allowDangerous: true properly bypasses security restrictions and allows browser launch with dangerous arguments when needed.

3. **Dashboard Navigation Test:** Use mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate to navigate to http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html and verify successful page load.

4. **Screenshot Functionality Test:** Test mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_screenshot to capture dashboard screenshots and verify image generation.

5. **Element Interaction Test:** Test click, fill, and evaluate functions on dashboard widgets to ensure full UI testing capabilities.

6. **Environment Compatibility Test:** Verify the configuration works in different environments (local development, Docker, WSL, ARM64).

7. **Error Handling Test:** Intentionally trigger various error conditions to verify improved error messages and guidance.

8. **Security Validation:** Ensure that the default configuration maintains appropriate security boundaries while the allowDangerous flag provides explicit opt-in for less secure configurations when needed.

9. **ARM64 Specific Test:** Verify that the Puppeteer browser launches correctly on ARM64 architecture with the appropriate Chrome/Chromium binaries and launch configurations.
