# Task ID: 5
# Title: Real-Time Dashboard Updates Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create WebSocket infrastructure and real-time data streaming to enable live dashboard updates for agent status, task progress, and system health monitoring without manual refresh.
# Details:
1. **WebSocket Server Implementation:** Set up a WebSocket server alongside the existing API backend using Socket.IO or native WebSocket implementation. Configure connection handling, authentication, and message routing for different event types (agent-status, task-updates, system-health).

2. **Event Broadcasting System:** Implement an event-driven architecture that captures changes from TaskMaster and broadcasts them to connected dashboard clients. Create event emitters for: agent status changes (online/offline/busy), task progress updates (started/completed/failed), system health metrics (CPU/memory/queue-depth).

3. **Client-Side WebSocket Integration:** Modify the dashboard frontend to establish WebSocket connections and handle real-time events. Implement automatic reconnection logic, message queuing for offline periods, and graceful degradation to polling if WebSocket fails.

4. **Data Synchronization Layer:** Create a synchronization mechanism to ensure dashboard state consistency between WebSocket updates and REST API calls. Implement conflict resolution for concurrent updates and maintain a local state cache for optimal performance.

5. **Performance Optimization:** Implement message throttling and debouncing for high-frequency updates. Use delta updates instead of full state transfers. Add connection pooling and implement horizontal scaling support for multiple WebSocket server instances.

6. **Monitoring and Debugging:** Add WebSocket connection metrics, message flow tracking, and debugging tools. Implement logging for connection lifecycle events and error scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
1. **WebSocket Connection Tests:** Verify successful WebSocket handshake and authentication. Test connection persistence, automatic reconnection after network interruption, and proper cleanup on disconnection.

2. **Real-Time Update Tests:** Simulate agent status changes and verify immediate dashboard updates. Test task progress events propagation with multiple connected clients. Verify system health metrics streaming at configured intervals.

3. **Load Testing:** Connect 100+ simultaneous dashboard clients and measure update latency. Test message delivery under high-frequency update scenarios. Verify server resource usage remains within acceptable limits.

4. **Integration Tests:** Use Puppeteer to verify real-time updates appear in the dashboard UI without refresh. Test fallback to polling when WebSocket connection fails. Verify data consistency between WebSocket updates and REST API responses.

5. **Error Handling Tests:** Test behavior during server restart, network partition scenarios, and authentication failures. Verify message queue functionality during temporary disconnections.
