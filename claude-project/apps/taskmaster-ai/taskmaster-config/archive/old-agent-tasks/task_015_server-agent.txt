# Task ID: 15
# Title: Launch TaskMaster API Server with Multi-Agent Coordination
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Launch the TaskMaster API server with multi-agent coordination to make the dashboard live, starting the server on port 3001 and ensuring WebSocket connections are working for real-time agent coordination.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
1. Configure the TaskMaster API server to listen on port 3001.
2. Implement WebSocket support for real-time communication between agents and the server.
3. Establish a multi-agent coordination system to manage task assignments and updates.
4. Integrate the TaskMaster API with the dashboard to provide live task data.
5. Implement error handling and logging for the server and WebSocket connections.
6. Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for agent connections.
7. Optimize server performance for handling multiple concurrent agent connections.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the TaskMaster API server starts successfully on port 3001.
2. Test WebSocket connections by simulating multiple agent connections and verifying real-time data updates on the dashboard.
3. Confirm that the multi-agent coordination system correctly manages task assignments and updates.
4. Monitor server performance under load to ensure stability and responsiveness.
5. Test error handling and logging mechanisms by simulating connection errors and verifying proper error messages are displayed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Server Agent: Deploy TaskMaster API server on port 3001 [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Launch the multi-agent coordination system server using npm start command. Verify WebSocket connections and dashboard accessibility.
