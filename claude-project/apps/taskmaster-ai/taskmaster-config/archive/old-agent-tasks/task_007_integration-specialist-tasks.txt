# Task ID: 7
# Title: Install Tailwind CSS MCP and Shadcn/UI MCP servers for modern component-based styling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and configure Tailwind CSS MCP server and Shadcn/UI MCP server to enable modern utility-first CSS framework and beautiful pre-built components for the dashboard interface.
# Details:
1. Update .mcp.json configuration to include both Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI MCP servers
2. Install required dependencies: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography
3. Initialize Tailwind CSS configuration with proper content paths for React components
4. Configure Tailwind CSS build process integration with the existing build system
5. Set up Shadcn/UI component library with proper TypeScript configuration
6. Configure component.json for Shadcn/UI with appropriate paths and styling preferences
7. Test MCP server connections and verify both servers are accessible through Claude Code
8. Create initial Tailwind configuration with custom color palette and design tokens
9. Set up CSS import structure for Tailwind directives in the main stylesheet
10. Verify compatibility with existing React components and build process

✅ Build system integrated with Vite (npm run build working)
✅ Configuration files created (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, components.json)
✅ CSS variables and theme system established
✅ Component structure ready for Shadcn/UI
✅ Test files created for verification
✅ Compatible with existing dashboard workflow

FILES CREATED:
- tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, components.json

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify MCP servers are running by checking connection status in Claude Code
2. Test Tailwind CSS compilation by adding utility classes to a test component
3. Install a basic Shadcn/UI component (like Button) using the MCP server
4. Verify the installed component renders correctly with proper styling
5. Test hot module replacement works with Tailwind changes
6. Confirm TypeScript recognizes Shadcn/UI component imports without errors
7. Test responsive design utilities work correctly across different viewport sizes
8. Verify custom Tailwind configuration is applied (colors, spacing, etc.)
9. Ensure CSS bundle size is optimized with proper purging of unused styles
10. Test integration with existing React development workflow
