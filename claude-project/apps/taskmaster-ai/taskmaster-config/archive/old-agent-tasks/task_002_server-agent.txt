# Task ID: 2
# Title: QA Testing: PIN Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform QA testing on the PIN Authentication System to ensure proper functionality, security, and integration with the family home page system.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Authentication System
# Details:
Validate the PIN Authentication System implementation by testing the following aspects:

1.  PIN Setup: Verify that users can successfully set up a PIN for authentication.
2.  Login/Logout: Ensure that users can log in and log out using their PIN.
3.  Rate Limiting: Test the rate limiting mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks.
4.  Auto-Lock: Confirm that the system automatically locks accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
5.  Session Management: Validate that user sessions are properly managed and secured.
6.  Protected Routes: Verify that protected routes are only accessible to authenticated users.
7.  Responsive Design: Ensure that the authentication pages are responsive and work correctly on different devices and screen sizes.
8.  Dashboard Integration: Verify that the authentication system is properly integrated with the dashboard system, and user roles and permissions are correctly enforced.
9. Security Features: Verify all security features work correctly, including protection against common web vulnerabilities.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Deploy the authentication system at http://localhost:3001/auth.html.
2.  Create test accounts and set up PINs for each account.
3.  Attempt to log in with valid and invalid PINs to test the login functionality.
4.  Test the logout functionality to ensure that user sessions are properly terminated.
5.  Simulate brute-force attacks to test the rate limiting and auto-lock mechanisms.
6.  Access protected routes with and without authentication to verify access control.
7.  Test the authentication pages on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsive design.
8.  Verify that user roles and permissions are correctly enforced within the dashboard system.
9.  Use security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them.
