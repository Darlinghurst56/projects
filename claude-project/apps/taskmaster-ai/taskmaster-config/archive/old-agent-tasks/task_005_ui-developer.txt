PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
1. Configure the server agent to execute the `npm run dev` command within the dashboard project directory.
2. Verify that the server agent has the necessary permissions to start the development server.
3. Implement error handling to capture and log any issues encountered during server startup.
4. Ensure the server agent monitors the server process and restarts it automatically if it crashes.
5. Document the server agent configuration and usage instructions for other developers.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the development server starts successfully via the server agent.
2. Access the dashboard in a web browser and confirm that the latest UI fixes and widget grid improvements are present.
3. Simulate server crashes to ensure the server agent restarts the server automatically.
4. Check the server agent logs for any error messages or warnings.
5. Test the dashboard on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
