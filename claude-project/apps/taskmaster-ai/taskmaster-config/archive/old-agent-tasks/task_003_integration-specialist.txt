# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create API Backend Server with TaskMaster Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an API backend server to replace the existing dashboard fallback data source and enable real-time multi-agent coordination through TaskMaster integration.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
1.  **API Design and Implementation:** Design RESTful API endpoints for retrieving task-related data, agent status, and coordination messages. Implement the API using a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) with proper authentication and authorization.
2.  **Data Source Integration:** Connect the API backend to the TaskMaster system to fetch real-time task data. Implement data transformation and caching mechanisms to optimize performance and reduce load on TaskMaster.
3.  **Real-time Communication:** Integrate a real-time communication framework (e.g., WebSockets, Socket.IO) to facilitate real-time updates and coordination between agents and the dashboard.
4.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to track API usage, identify issues, and ensure system stability.
5.  **Deployment:** Containerize the API backend using Docker and deploy it to a suitable environment (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS).

# Test Strategy:
1.  **API Endpoint Testing:** Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test all API endpoints, verifying correct data retrieval, filtering, and pagination.
2.  **Real-time Communication Testing:** Simulate multiple agents and dashboard clients to test the real-time communication functionality, ensuring messages are delivered reliably and with minimal latency.
3.  **Performance Testing:** Conduct load testing to evaluate the API's performance under high traffic conditions, identifying potential bottlenecks and optimizing performance.
4.  **Security Testing:** Perform security scans to identify vulnerabilities and ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
5.  **Integration Testing:** Verify the API backend integrates seamlessly with the TaskMaster system and the dashboard, ensuring data consistency and functionality.
