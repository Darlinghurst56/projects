# Task ID: 6
# Title: Install and configure Cron/Scheduler MCP server for complex task scheduling and automated widget updates
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up task scheduling capabilities using node-cron for automated dashboard widget updates and background job management, with optional custom MCP server development for Claude Code integration.
# Details:
1. Install node-cron package for programmatic task scheduling
2. Create scheduling service module for dashboard widget automation
3. Implement weather widget refresh scheduling (every 5 minutes)
4. Set up daily session cleanup scheduling
5. Create job management utilities (list active jobs, cancel, run immediately)
6. Implement error handling and logging for scheduled tasks
7. Set up notification system for failed scheduled jobs
8. Create dashboard interface for viewing and managing scheduled tasks
9. Implement backup and cleanup schedules for data maintenance
10. Optional: Develop custom MCP server for Claude Code integration with scheduling capabilities
11. Test scheduling with various cron patterns and validate proper execution timing

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify node-cron installation and basic functionality
2. Test weather widget refresh scheduling with 5-minute intervals
3. Test daily session cleanup execution
4. Validate job cancellation and immediate execution functionality
5. Test error handling for invalid cron patterns
6. Verify widget refresh scheduling with actual API calls
7. Test job persistence and management across application restarts
8. Test concurrent job execution and resource management
9. Validate logging and notification systems for job failures
10. Confirm dashboard interface displays scheduled tasks correctly
11. If implemented: Test custom MCP server integration with Claude Code
