# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Automated Accessibility Testing Module for Home User Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an automated accessibility testing module for the single home user dashboard to ensure WCAG compliance. This module will focus on identifying and reporting accessibility issues within the dashboard's UI elements and content.
# Details:
1.  Research and select an appropriate accessibility testing tool/library (e.g., axe-core, pa11y) suitable for automated testing within the existing development environment.
2.  Integrate the selected tool into the project's testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to enable automated accessibility checks during the build process.
3.  Define a set of WCAG compliance rules to be enforced by the testing module, focusing on the most relevant guidelines for the dashboard's functionality.
4.  Implement automated tests to check for common accessibility issues, such as missing alt text for images, insufficient color contrast, improper use of ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation problems.
5.  Configure the testing module to generate detailed reports of accessibility violations, including the location of the issue, the WCAG guideline violated, and suggested remediation steps.
6.  Implement a mechanism to automatically fail the build if accessibility violations are detected, ensuring that new code adheres to accessibility standards.
7.  Create documentation on how to run and interpret the accessibility tests, including instructions for developers on how to fix common accessibility issues.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Run the automated accessibility tests on the dashboard's UI elements and content.
2.  Verify that the tests accurately identify accessibility violations based on the defined WCAG compliance rules.
3.  Check that the generated reports provide sufficient information for developers to understand and fix the identified issues.
4.  Simulate different user scenarios (e.g., using a screen reader, navigating with the keyboard) to validate the effectiveness of the accessibility improvements.
5.  Manually review the dashboard's UI elements and content to ensure that the automated tests cover all relevant accessibility aspects.
6.  Verify that the build process fails when accessibility violations are detected, preventing the deployment of non-compliant code.
7.  Retest after remediation to confirm issues are resolved.
