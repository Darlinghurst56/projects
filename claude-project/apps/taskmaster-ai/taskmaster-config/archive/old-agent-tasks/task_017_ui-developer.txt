# Task ID: 17
# Title: MVP Priority 1: Single-Page Agent Control Hub
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15, 16, 14, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a single-page agent control hub by extending the existing live-agent-dashboard.html with simple on/off switches for agents, basic task assignment dropdown, and mobile-friendly responsive design focused on essential controls for home users.
# Details:
1. **Extend live-agent-dashboard.html:** Modify the existing dashboard file to incorporate new control features while maintaining the current functionality. Keep the existing WebSocket/SSE connections for real-time updates.

2. **Agent On/Off Switches:** Implement simple toggle switches for each agent using native HTML/CSS or lightweight components. Each switch should:
   - Display agent name and current status (active/inactive)
   - Use <input type="checkbox"> with custom styling for accessibility
   - Send status updates to backend via existing WebSocket connection
   - Show visual feedback during state transitions

3. **Task Assignment Dropdown:** Create a basic dropdown for quick task assignment:
   - Populate with pending tasks from the task management system
   - Group tasks by agent type for easier selection
   - Include search/filter functionality for long task lists
   - Submit assignments through existing API endpoints

4. **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Implement responsive layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox:
   - Design for minimum 320px width (mobile phones)
   - Use touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px)
   - Stack controls vertically on small screens
   - Test on common breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px
   - Ensure all controls are thumb-reachable on mobile

5. **Simplification Strategy:**
   - Remove any enterprise-level features or complex configurations
   - Focus on core functionality: start/stop agents, assign tasks
   - Use system fonts and minimal CSS for fast loading
   - Avoid external dependencies or heavy frameworks
   - Keep JavaScript minimal and vanilla where possible

6. **Accessibility Considerations:**
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Add proper ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works for all controls
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA compliance)
   - Test with browser zoom up to 200%

# Test Strategy:
1. **Mobile Device Testing:** Test on actual devices including iPhone SE (small), standard Android phone, iPad, and laptop. Verify all controls are easily tappable and text is readable without zooming.

2. **Functionality Testing:**
   - Toggle each agent on/off and verify state persistence
   - Assign tasks via dropdown and confirm successful assignment
   - Test with 0, 1, 10, and 50+ tasks in the dropdown
   - Verify real-time updates when agents change state externally

3. **Responsive Design Validation:**
   - Use browser dev tools to test at 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
   - Verify no horizontal scrolling at any viewport size
   - Confirm all controls remain accessible and functional
   - Test landscape orientation on mobile devices

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure page load time on 3G connection (target < 3 seconds)
   - Verify smooth interactions with no JavaScript errors
   - Test with 10+ agents running simultaneously
   - Monitor WebSocket connection stability

5. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox on desktop
   - Test on Chrome and Safari on iOS
   - Test on Chrome on Android
   - Verify consistent behavior across all platforms

6. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Navigate entire interface using only keyboard
   - Test with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac/iOS)
   - Verify all interactive elements have proper focus indicators
   - Check color contrast with automated tools
