# Task ID: 16
# Title: Human-Centered Dashboard UX Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fix 'cannot read properties of undefined' JavaScript errors, integrate live autonomous agent data display, implement real-time WebSocket updates, and create accessible, responsive dashboard interface using MCP design tools
# Details:
1. **JavaScript Error Resolution:** Debug and fix all 'cannot read properties of undefined' errors in the dashboard. Implement null checks and optional chaining for all object property accesses. Use try-catch blocks for async operations and add proper error boundaries for React components if applicable.

2. **Live Agent Data Integration:** Implement WebSocket connection to the background agent system for real-time updates. Create a data synchronization layer that handles connection management, automatic reconnection, and state updates. Structure the WebSocket handler to process agent status updates, task progress, and completion notifications.

3. **Real-Time Update Implementation:** Build a reactive UI layer that responds to WebSocket events. Implement efficient DOM updates using virtual DOM diffing or targeted element updates. Create visual indicators for data freshness and connection status. Add smooth transitions and animations for data changes.

4. **Accessible Interface Design:** Use MCP design-system tools to generate accessible components. Implement ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Ensure all interactive elements have proper focus states and meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Test with mcp__accessibility-testing-mcp tools.

5. **Responsive Layout:** Create a mobile-first responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Implement breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Ensure touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices. Use mcp__design-system-mcp to maintain consistent spacing and typography.

6. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for network failures, WebSocket disconnections, and data parsing errors. Display user-friendly error messages and provide recovery actions. Log errors to console with detailed context for debugging.

# Test Strategy:
1. **JavaScript Error Testing:** Use browser developer tools to monitor for console errors during all user interactions. Run automated tests to trigger various states and edge cases. Verify no 'undefined' errors occur during normal operation or error conditions.

2. **WebSocket Testing:** Test connection establishment, data reception, and automatic reconnection. Simulate network failures and verify graceful degradation. Monitor WebSocket frames in browser dev tools to ensure proper message formatting.

3. **Accessibility Testing:** Run mcp__accessibility-testing-mcp tools to validate WCAG compliance. Test keyboard navigation flow and screen reader announcements. Verify color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards. Test with actual assistive technologies.

4. **Responsive Testing:** Test on multiple devices and screen sizes using browser dev tools. Verify layout integrity at all breakpoints. Test touch interactions on actual mobile devices. Ensure no horizontal scrolling or layout breaks.

5. **Performance Testing:** Monitor render performance during real-time updates. Verify no memory leaks from WebSocket connections or DOM updates. Test with high-frequency updates to ensure UI remains responsive.

6. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Verify WebSocket compatibility and JavaScript feature support. Test on both desktop and mobile versions of browsers.
