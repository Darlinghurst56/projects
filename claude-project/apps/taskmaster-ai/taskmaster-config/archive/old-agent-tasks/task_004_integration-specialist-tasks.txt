# Task ID: 4
# Title: Authentication Context and Session Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement React Context API for PIN-based authentication state, localStorage session management, custom useAuth hooks, and session timeout detection for dashboard security. This task ensures secure and persistent user sessions within the application.
# Details:
1.  Set up React Context API to manage the authentication state, including user PIN and session status.
2.  Implement localStorage session management to persist user sessions across browser sessions.
3.  Develop custom useAuth hooks to provide authentication functionality to React components.
4.  Implement session timeout detection to automatically log out users after a period of inactivity.
5.  Integrate the authentication context with the Agent Coordination Dashboard and Control D dashboard to enforce PIN-based access control.
6.  Ensure that the authentication state is properly updated upon successful login, logout, and session timeout.
7.  Implement error handling and user feedback for authentication failures.
8.  Securely store and manage PINs, following security best practices.
9.  Consider implementing a mechanism for users to reset their PINs if forgotten.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the React Context API is correctly managing the authentication state.
2.  Test that localStorage session management persists user sessions across browser sessions.
3.  Ensure that the custom useAuth hooks provide authentication functionality to React components.
4.  Verify that session timeout detection automatically logs out users after a period of inactivity.
5.  Test the integration of the authentication context with the Agent Coordination Dashboard and Control D dashboard.
6.  Ensure that the authentication state is properly updated upon successful login, logout, and session timeout.
7.  Test error handling and user feedback for authentication failures.
8.  Verify that PINs are securely stored and managed.
9.  Test the PIN reset mechanism.
