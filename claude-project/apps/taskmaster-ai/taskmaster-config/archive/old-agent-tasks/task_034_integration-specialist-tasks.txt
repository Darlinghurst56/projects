# Task ID: 34
# Title: Test DNS Analytics Widget Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 17, 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Test and validate the DNS Analytics Widget implementation. QA specialist agent should verify widget functionality, data display, user interactions, error handling, and integration with the dashboard system.
# Details:
1.  **Functional Testing**: Verify all widget features function as expected, including data loading, display of analytics, user interactions (e.g., filtering, sorting), and error handling.
2.  **Data Validation**: Validate that the data displayed in the widget is accurate and consistent with the data from the Control D API. Verify data transformations and calculations are correct.
3.  **User Interface (UI) Testing**: Ensure the widget's UI is visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly. Check for any layout issues, alignment problems, or inconsistencies in the design.
4.  **Error Handling**: Test the widget's error handling capabilities by simulating various error scenarios (e.g., API failures, invalid data). Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
5.  **Integration Testing**: Verify the widget's integration with the dashboard system. Ensure that it interacts correctly with other dashboard components and that data is passed seamlessly between them.
6.  **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure the widget is accessible to users with disabilities by testing it with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
7.  **Performance Testing**: Measure the widget's performance by monitoring its loading time, memory usage, and CPU utilization. Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
8.  **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test the widget in different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure it functions correctly and looks consistent across all browsers.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing of the widget's features, data display, user interactions, and error handling.
2.  **Automated Testing**: Develop automated tests to verify the widget's functionality and data accuracy. Use testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha to write and run the tests.
3.  **API Integration Testing**: Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test the widget's API integration with the Control D API. Verify that the API requests are sent correctly and that the responses are processed as expected.
4.  **UI Testing**: Use UI testing tools like Selenium or Cypress to automate UI tests and verify the widget's visual appearance and responsiveness.
5.  **Accessibility Testing**: Use accessibility testing tools like WAVE or Axe to identify and fix any accessibility issues.
6.  **Performance Testing**: Use performance testing tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest to measure the widget's performance and identify areas for improvement.
7.  **Regression Testing**: After fixing any bugs or making changes to the widget, perform regression testing to ensure that the changes have not introduced any new issues.
