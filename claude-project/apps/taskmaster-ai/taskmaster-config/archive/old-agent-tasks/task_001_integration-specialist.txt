# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement LiteLLM Integration for Model Call Redirection
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5, 8 (Not found), 10 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement LiteLLM proxy server to redirect model calls to alternative sources, including network-hosted Ollama, providing unified API access, cost control, and reliability improvements.

PROJECT: Development Infrastructure | SUBPROJECT: Build Tools
# Details:
1.  **Docker Deployment:** Create a Dockerfile for the LiteLLM proxy server and configure Docker Compose for easy deployment.
2.  **Provider Configuration:** Implement configuration options for multiple providers (Anthropic, Google, Ollama) within LiteLLM, allowing dynamic switching and routing.
3.  **Cost Optimization Routing:** Develop routing logic to direct model calls based on cost, prioritizing cheaper providers when possible.
4.  **Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement fallback mechanisms to automatically switch to alternative providers in case of failures or rate limits.
5.  **TaskMaster Integration:** Integrate LiteLLM with TaskMaster to track model usage and costs per task.
6.  **Monitoring Setup:** Set up monitoring for the LiteLLM proxy server, including metrics for request latency, error rates, and provider usage.
7.  **Unified API Access:** Ensure that the LiteLLM proxy provides a unified API endpoint for all LLM interactions in the project.
8.  **Ollama Integration:** Configure LiteLLM to route requests to a network-hosted Ollama instance, enabling local model execution.
9.  **Security:** Implement necessary security measures to protect the LiteLLM proxy server and prevent unauthorized access.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Deploy the LiteLLM proxy server using Docker Compose.
2.  Configure multiple providers (Anthropic, Google, Ollama) with different API keys.
3.  Send test requests to the LiteLLM proxy and verify that they are correctly routed to the appropriate providers.
4.  Simulate provider failures and verify that the fallback mechanisms are working as expected.
5.  Check TaskMaster to ensure that model usage and costs are being tracked correctly.
6.  Monitor the LiteLLM proxy server for request latency, error rates, and provider usage.
7.  Verify that the unified API endpoint is working as expected.
8.  Test Ollama integration by sending requests to the LiteLLM proxy and verifying that they are being processed by the network-hosted Ollama instance.
9.  Perform security testing to ensure that the LiteLLM proxy server is protected against unauthorized access.

AGENT: integration-specialist - Starting Docker environment setup for LiteLLM proxy integration.

**Phase 1 Implementation Begin:**
- Creating dedicated LiteLLM project directory structure
- Setting up Docker Compose configuration for proxy deployment
- Establishing base LiteLLM configuration with multi-provider support
- Implementing environment variable management for API keys
- Preparing network configuration for Ollama integration

**Current Progress:**
Starting with directory structure creation and Docker Compose setup to provide foundation for LiteLLM proxy server deployment.

AGENT: integration-specialist - Docker environment setup completed successfully!

**Phase 1 Implementation Complete:**
✅ Created comprehensive LiteLLM project structure:
- `docker-compose.yml`: Multi-service deployment with health checks, resource limits, and network configuration
- `config/litellm_config.yaml`: Complete multi-provider configuration with cost optimization and fallback routing  
- `.env.example`: Template with all required environment variables
- `scripts/setup.sh`: Automated setup and validation script
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guide

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Multi-provider support (Anthropic, Google, Ollama)
- Cost-based routing with automatic fallbacks
- TaskMaster-specific model aliases 
- Network-hosted Ollama integration
- Built-in monitoring and health checks
- Security controls and rate limiting
- Comprehensive logging and analytics

**Configuration Validation:**
✅ YAML syntax validated successfully
✅ Docker Compose structure verified
✅ Environment template created
✅ Setup automation completed

**Docker Status**: Configuration ready for deployment (Docker integration with WSL2 needs activation)

Ready for Phase 2: Multi-provider configuration testing and deployment.
