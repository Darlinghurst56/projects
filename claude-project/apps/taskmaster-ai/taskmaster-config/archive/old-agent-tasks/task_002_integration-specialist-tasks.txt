# Task ID: 2
# Title: QA Testing: PIN Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive QA testing on the PIN Authentication System, focusing on security architecture, session management, and dashboard integration.
# Details:
Validate the PIN Authentication System implementation by testing the following aspects:

1.  PIN Setup: Verify that users can successfully set up a PIN for authentication.
2.  Login/Logout: Ensure that users can log in and log out using their PIN.
3.  Rate Limiting: Test the rate limiting mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks.
4.  Auto-Lock: Confirm that the system automatically locks accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
5.  Session Management: Validate that user sessions are properly managed and secured.
6.  Protected Routes: Verify that protected routes are only accessible to authenticated users.
7.  Responsive Design: Ensure that the authentication pages are responsive and work correctly on different devices and screen sizes.
8.  Dashboard Integration: Verify that the authentication system is properly integrated with the dashboard system, and user roles and permissions are correctly enforced.
9. Security Features: Verify all security features work correctly, including protection against common web vulnerabilities.

PHASE 1: SECURITY ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS - Systematic validation of PIN authentication security, session management, and integration systems.

# Test Strategy:
Test Plan:
1. Authentication flow validation: Validate the complete authentication flow, including PIN setup, login, and logout processes.
2. Security mechanisms testing: Thoroughly test all security mechanisms, including encryption, hashing, and data validation.
3. Session management verification: Verify that user sessions are properly managed, secured, and terminated upon logout or timeout.
4. Rate limiting and brute-force protection: Simulate brute-force attacks to ensure that the rate limiting and auto-lock mechanisms effectively prevent unauthorized access.
5. Protected route access control: Verify that protected routes are only accessible to authenticated users with the appropriate roles and permissions.
6. Dashboard integration validation: Validate the integration between the authentication system and the dashboard, ensuring seamless user experience and data consistency.
7. Responsive design testing: Test the authentication pages on various devices and screen sizes to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design.
8. Vulnerability assessment: Use security scanning tools and manual testing techniques to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the authentication system.

1.  Deploy the authentication system at http://localhost:3001/auth.html.
2.  Create test accounts and set up PINs for each account.
3.  Attempt to log in with valid and invalid PINs to test the login functionality.
4.  Test the logout functionality to ensure that user sessions are properly terminated.
5.  Simulate brute-force attacks to test the rate limiting and auto-lock mechanisms.
6.  Access protected routes with and without authentication to verify access control.
7.  Test the authentication pages on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsive design.
8.  Verify that user roles and permissions are correctly enforced within the dashboard system.
9.  Use security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them.
