# Task ID: 7
# Title: Fix Puppeteer Chrome Browser Launch Failure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Diagnose and resolve the Puppeteer Chrome browser launch failure, which is currently blocking QA testing. This involves checking Chrome binary integrity, clearing the Puppeteer cache, reinstalling dependencies, and testing alternative launch configurations. Task officially assigned to server-agent role and will remain in server-agent tag until completely resolved and QA testing capabilities restored.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Quality Assurance System
# Details:
SERVER-AGENT ASSIGNMENT: This task is officially assigned to the server-agent role for systematic execution of all 6 subtasks until complete resolution.

1. Check Chrome binary integrity and file permissions in /root/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/linux-131.0.6778.204/chrome-linux64/. Ensure the binary is not corrupted and has execute permissions.
2. Clear the Puppeteer cache directory located at /root/.cache/puppeteer/.
3. Reinstall Puppeteer and Chrome dependencies using npm or yarn. Specifically, run `npm install puppeteer` or `yarn add puppeteer`.
4. Install missing Linux system dependencies required by Chrome. This may include installing packages like `libgbm1`, `libxshm`, `libasound2`, etc. Use `apt-get update` and `apt-get install` to install these dependencies.
5. Test alternative browser launch configurations by specifying different executable paths or launch arguments in the Puppeteer launch options.
6. Verify system resource availability (CPU, memory, disk space) to ensure the server has sufficient resources to launch Chrome.
7. Review server logs for any additional error messages or clues related to the launch failure.

Agent responsible for systematic execution of all subtasks and restoring QA testing capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the Chrome binary exists and has the correct permissions.
2. Confirm that the Puppeteer cache directory is cleared.
3. Ensure that all required dependencies are installed without errors.
4. Test the Puppeteer Chrome browser launch by running a simple Puppeteer script that launches Chrome and navigates to a website.
5. Monitor system resource utilization during the browser launch to identify any resource constraints.
6. Check server logs for any error messages or warnings during the browser launch.
7. Confirm that QA testing is no longer blocked and that the DNS Analytics Widget can be tested successfully.
8. Validate that server-agent has successfully completed all assigned subtasks and restored full QA testing capabilities.

### Details:
Test mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate to confirm UI testing capabilities are restored and QA testing can proceed
<info added on 2025-07-06T07:59:10.480Z>
SERVER-AGENT: âœ… COMPLETE SUCCESS! MCP Puppeteer integration fully restored. Browser launch working with ARM64 Chromium. Screenshot captured successfully. QA testing capabilities restored. Root cause was x86-64 vs ARM64 architecture mismatch - fixed by clearing cache and using system Chromium browser.
</info added on 2025-07-06T07:59:10.480Z>

## 4. Check Chrome Binary Integrity [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify the Chrome binary is not corrupted and has execute permissions.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: General System
### Details:
Check Chrome binary integrity and file permissions in /root/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/linux-131.0.6778.204/chrome-linux64/.
<info added on 2025-07-06T07:49:04.053Z>
SERVER-AGENT: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - Architecture mismatch detected. System is ARM64 (aarch64) but Puppeteer downloaded x86-64 Chrome binary from cache. This causes 'cannot execute binary file: Exec format error' which manifests as misleading syntax error in shell execution. The Chrome binary at /root/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/linux-131.0.6778.204/chrome-linux64/ is incompatible with ARM64 architecture. Solution requires clearing Puppeteer cache and forcing ARM64-compatible Chrome download on next installation.

## 5. Clear Puppeteer Cache [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clear the Puppeteer cache directory.

### Details:
Clear the Puppeteer cache directory located at /root/.cache/puppeteer/.
<info added on 2025-07-06T07:50:52.116Z>
SERVER-AGENT: Successfully cleared corrupted Puppeteer cache directory. Removed x86-64 Chrome binary that was incompatible with ARM64 system. Cache cleared completely to force fresh ARM64 Chrome download on next Puppeteer installation.
