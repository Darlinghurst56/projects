# Task ID: 16
# Title: Monitor and Maintain TaskMaster API Server
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Monitor and maintain the live TaskMaster API server. Check server logs, verify port accessibility, ensure WebSocket connections remain stable, and implement server health monitoring dashboard endpoint.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
1. Implement a server health monitoring endpoint that provides real-time status of the TaskMaster API server, including CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.
2. Continuously monitor server logs for errors, warnings, and other anomalies. Implement automated alerts for critical issues.
3. Verify that the TaskMaster API server is accessible on port 3001.
4. Ensure WebSocket connections remain stable and handle reconnections gracefully.
5. Implement automated restarts for the TaskMaster API server in case of failures.
6. Regularly review and update server configurations to optimize performance and security.
7. Document all monitoring and maintenance procedures.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the server health monitoring endpoint returns accurate and up-to-date server status information.
2. Simulate server failures and verify that automated restarts are triggered correctly.
3. Test WebSocket connections by simulating multiple agent connections and verifying real-time data updates on the dashboard.
4. Monitor server logs for errors and warnings, and verify that alerts are triggered for critical issues.
5. Perform regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
