# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement API Token Usage Monitoring and Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 24, 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive API token usage monitoring and tracking for AI agents, including debugging the local Ollama installation and creating a usage tracking dashboard with alerts.
# Details:
1.  **Ollama Debugging and Integration:**
    *   Diagnose and resolve issues with the local Ollama installation.
    *   Ensure seamless integration with the agent architecture for local model usage.
    *   Implement configuration settings for Ollama within the agent system.
2.  **API Usage Monitoring:**
    *   Implement monitoring for all AI model providers (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.).
    *   Track token usage for each provider.
    *   Capture API request and response data for debugging.
3.  **Usage Tracking Dashboard:**
    *   Develop a dashboard to visualize API token usage.
    *   Display cost metrics based on token consumption.
    *   Implement filtering by agent, model provider, and time range.
4.  **Alerting System:**
    *   Create alerts for high token usage.
    *   Implement alerts for failed API requests.
    *   Configure notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).
5.  **Agent-Specific Usage Tracking:**
    *   Track token usage patterns for individual AI agents.
    *   Identify agents with high or unusual usage.
    *   Provide insights into agent behavior and optimization opportunities.
6.  **Cloud and Local Model Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor both cloud API calls and local model usage.
    *   Differentiate between cloud and local token consumption.
    *   Provide a unified view of overall token usage.
7.  **Integration with AI Model Abstraction Layer:**
    *   Utilize the AI model abstraction layer (Task 33) to seamlessly monitor usage across different AI models.
    *   Ensure that the monitoring system is compatible with the pluggable architecture.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Ollama Integration Testing:**
    *   Verify that the Ollama installation is functioning correctly.
    *   Test the integration with the agent architecture.
    *   Ensure that local model usage is accurately tracked.
2.  **API Monitoring Validation:**
    *   Simulate API calls to different model providers.
    *   Verify that token usage is correctly captured.
    *   Test the accuracy of API request and response data.
3.  **Dashboard Verification:**
    *   Validate that the dashboard displays accurate token usage data.
    *   Test the filtering and sorting capabilities.
    *   Ensure that cost metrics are correctly calculated.
4.  **Alerting System Testing:**
    *   Configure alerts for different thresholds.
    *   Verify that notifications are sent when alerts are triggered.
    *   Test the alert resolution process.
5.  **Agent-Specific Tracking Validation:**
    *   Simulate different agent usage patterns.
    *   Verify that agent-specific token usage is accurately tracked.
    *   Test the identification of agents with high or unusual usage.
6.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Test the complete monitoring system from API call to dashboard display.
    *   Verify that all components are working together seamlessly.
    *   Ensure that the system is scalable and can handle high volumes of API calls.
