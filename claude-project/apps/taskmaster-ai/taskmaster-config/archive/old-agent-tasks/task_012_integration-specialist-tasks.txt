# Title: Fix DNS Profile Widget to Display Real Control D Profile Data
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace the fake/blank content in the DNS Profile Widget with actual Control D profile data by implementing proper API integration to fetch and display real profile configurations, service blocking rules, and DNS filtering settings. This task is assigned to the integration-specialist role for Control D API integration.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current DNS Profile Widget implementation to understand the existing structure and identify where fake data is being generated
2. Review the Control D API documentation for the /profiles endpoint to understand the response structure and required authentication
3. Implement proper API integration:
   - Create or update the API client to handle the /profiles endpoint
   - Add proper authentication headers (API key or token)
   - Handle the API response and map it to the widget's data structure
4. Update the widget component to:
   - Remove all hardcoded/fake profile data
   - Fetch real profiles from the Control D API on component mount
   - Display the actual services from the user's account
   - Show real service blocking rules and DNS filtering settings
   - Handle loading states while fetching data
   - Implement error handling for API failures
5. Ensure the widget displays:
   - Profile names and IDs
   - Service blocking configurations
   - DNS filtering rules and settings
   - Profile status (active/inactive)
   - Any custom rules or exceptions
6. Add proper error boundaries and fallback UI for when the API is unavailable
7. Implement caching strategy to avoid excessive API calls
8. Update any related documentation or comments to reflect the real data integration

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the widget no longer displays fake or blank profile data
2. Test API integration:
   - Confirm the /profiles endpoint is called with proper authentication
   - Verify services are fetched and displayed correctly
   - Test error handling by simulating API failures
3. Validate data display:
   - Check that profile names match the Control D account
   - Verify service blocking rules are accurately displayed
   - Confirm DNS filtering settings are shown correctly
4. Test edge cases:
   - Empty profile list
   - Single profile vs multiple profiles
   - Profiles with complex filtering rules
5. Performance testing:
   - Measure widget load time with real data
   - Verify caching prevents unnecessary API calls
6. User experience testing:
   - Ensure loading states are displayed during data fetch
   - Confirm error messages are user-friendly
   - Test widget responsiveness with varying amounts of profile data
7. Integration testing with the main dashboard to ensure the widget functions correctly within the larger application context
