# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create User Testing MVP for Automated User Journey Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a User Testing Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to automate user journey validation, focusing on task flows and user experience for a single home user scenario. This MVP will provide a foundation for more complex user testing in the future.
# Details:
1. Define key user journeys for the single home user scenario, including onboarding, device setup, and basic feature usage.
2. Select an appropriate automation framework for user interface testing (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright) that supports cross-browser compatibility and headless execution.
3. Implement automated test scripts for each defined user journey, simulating user interactions and validating expected outcomes.
4. Integrate the user testing MVP with the existing CI/CD pipeline to enable automated testing during the build process.
5. Design a reporting mechanism to provide clear and concise feedback on test results, including screenshots and error logs.
6. Implement data masking and anonymization techniques to protect user privacy during testing.

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute the automated user journey tests on various browsers and operating systems to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
2. Verify that the tests accurately simulate user interactions and validate expected outcomes for each user journey.
3. Check that the reporting mechanism provides sufficient information for developers to understand and address any identified issues.
4. Monitor the performance of the automated tests to ensure they are running efficiently and not introducing delays into the CI/CD pipeline.
5. Conduct manual exploratory testing to supplement the automated tests and identify any usability issues not covered by the automated scripts.
