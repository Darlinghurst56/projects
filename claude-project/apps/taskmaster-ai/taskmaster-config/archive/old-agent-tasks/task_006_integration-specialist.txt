# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Widget API Integrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement API integrations for new House AI widgets including Google Calendar, Weather, Control D Schedules, and LLM Chat, ensuring secure authentication, error handling, and data transformation for widget consumption.
# Details:
1. **API Integration:** Implement integrations for Google Calendar (OAuth 2.0), Weather (OpenWeatherMap/similar), Control D Schedule, and Ollama/Open WebUI API for LLM chat.
2. **Authentication and Security:** Implement secure API key management and storage. Use OAuth 2.0 for Google Calendar and ensure secure token storage and refresh mechanisms for all APIs.
3. **Data Transformation:** Transform API data into a format suitable for widget consumption. Implement data caching to optimize performance and reduce API load.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms for API failures. Implement rate limiting and request optimization to prevent abuse and ensure stability.
5. **Bookmarks Integration:** Implement Bookmarks HTML file parsing and processing for the Bookmarks Widget.
6. **Widget Integration:** Integrate the API data into the Calendar, Weather, Control D Schedules, LLM Chat, and Bookmarks widgets.

# Test Strategy:
1. **API Authentication Tests:** Verify that all APIs are properly authenticated and functional. Test token storage and refresh mechanisms.
2. **Data Retrieval Tests:** Verify that data is correctly retrieved from each API and transformed into the expected format for widget consumption.
3. **Error Handling Tests:** Simulate API failures and verify that graceful error handling mechanisms are in place. Test fallback mechanisms.
4. **Rate Limiting Tests:** Test rate limiting and request optimization to ensure the system can handle high traffic without issues.
5. **Widget Display Tests:** Verify that the data is correctly displayed in each widget (Calendar, Weather, Control D Schedules, LLM Chat, and Bookmarks).
6. **Security Tests:** Ensure that API keys and tokens are securely stored and managed.
