# Task ID: 22
# Title: Create Smart Agent Management Dashboard for Web UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 20, 15, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive web-based dashboard that integrates the smart agent launcher system with visual agent management, real-time monitoring, and human-centered task workflow visualization. This dashboard will provide intuitive controls for launching, monitoring, and managing autonomous agents through a user-friendly web interface.
# Details:
1. **Dashboard Structure:** Create a new React component named `SmartAgentDashboard` within the `src/components` directory. This component will serve as the main container for the entire dashboard.
2. **Visual Agent Management:** Implement a visual representation of the agents, including agent timeline views and task tree visualizations. Use a library like React-Vis or D3.js for creating these visualizations.
3. **Real-time Monitoring:** Integrate real-time data feeds using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to display agent status, task progress, and system metrics. Implement a data synchronization layer to handle connection interruptions and data inconsistencies.
4. **Human-Centered Task Workflow Visualization:** Design an intuitive task workflow visualization that allows users to easily understand the relationships between tasks and agents. Use color-coded status indicators to highlight task progress and potential issues.
5. **Intuitive Controls:** Implement intuitive controls for launching, monitoring, and managing autonomous agents. These controls should include buttons, dropdown menus, and input fields for configuring agent parameters and task assignments.
6. **Integration with Smart Agent Launcher System:** Integrate the dashboard with the existing smart agent launcher system to enable users to launch and manage agents directly from the web interface. Use the system's API to send commands and receive status updates.
7. **Responsive Design:** Implement a responsive layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox to ensure the dashboard adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Define breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
8. **Accessibility:** Ensure the dashboard is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines (WCAG). Use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML to improve screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Functional Testing:** Verify that all dashboard controls function as expected, including launching agents, assigning tasks, and monitoring progress. Test all edge cases and error conditions.
2. **Visual Testing:** Verify that the dashboard visualizations are accurate and easy to understand. Test the visualizations with different data sets and agent configurations.
3. **Performance Testing:** Measure the dashboard's performance under different load conditions. Optimize the code to ensure the dashboard remains responsive and efficient.
4. **Accessibility Testing:** Perform accessibility testing using automated tools and manual testing to ensure the dashboard meets accessibility guidelines. Verify that the dashboard is usable by users with disabilities.
5. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test the dashboard on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.
6. **Responsive Testing:** Test the dashboard on various devices and screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure it adapts correctly. Use browser developer tools to simulate different screen resolutions and orientations.
