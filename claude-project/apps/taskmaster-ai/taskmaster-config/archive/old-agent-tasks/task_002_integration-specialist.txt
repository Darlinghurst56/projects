# Task ID: 2
# Title: Deploy Multi-Agent System via Server Agent
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Deploy the multi-agent coordination system with human orchestrator via the Server Agent, ensuring all components are correctly configured and operational in the target environment.

PROJECT: TaskMaster Agent System | SUBPROJECT: Agent Coordination
# Details:
1.  **Environment Configuration:** Configure the target server environment with necessary dependencies (Python, required libraries, etc.).
2.  **Server Agent Setup:** Install and configure the Server Agent on the target server, ensuring it has the necessary permissions to deploy and manage the multi-agent system.
3.  **Component Deployment:** Utilize the Server Agent to deploy all components of the multi-agent system, including the human orchestrator interface, agent modules, and any supporting databases or message queues.
4.  **Configuration Management:** Implement a configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) to manage settings for each component, allowing for easy adjustments without code changes.
5.  **Logging and Monitoring:** Set up logging and monitoring for all components, enabling real-time insights into system performance and error detection.
6.  **Security Considerations:** Implement security measures to protect the deployed system, including access controls, data encryption, and vulnerability scanning.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Deployment Verification:** Verify that all components are successfully deployed and running on the target server using the Server Agent.
2.  **Functional Testing:** Conduct end-to-end functional tests to ensure the multi-agent system operates as expected, including interactions between agents and the human orchestrator.
3.  **Performance Testing:** Perform load testing to assess the system's performance under realistic workloads, identifying any bottlenecks or performance issues.
4.  **Security Auditing:** Conduct a security audit to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the deployed system.
5.  **Monitoring Validation:** Validate that logging and monitoring systems are correctly configured and providing accurate data.
