# Title: Refactor Dashboard Widget for Accessibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve dashboard widget accessibility by implementing ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation to ensure users with disabilities can interact with the widget effectively.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Dashboard UI System
# Details:
1. Review existing dashboard widgets and identify areas that require accessibility improvements.
2. Implement ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) for each widget component, such as buttons, links, and form fields.
3. Use semantic HTML to structure the widget's content and provide a clear hierarchy of elements.
4. Ensure keyboard navigation is possible by assigning accessible shortcuts to interactive elements.
5. Test the refactored widget with assistive technologies like screen readers and keyboard-only navigation to verify accessibility.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify ARIA attributes are correctly implemented using tools like Lighthouse or WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool.
2. Conduct user testing with users who have disabilities, ensuring they can interact with the refactored widget effectively.
3. Test the widget's keyboard navigation functionality to ensure it is possible and intuitive.
4. Verify the widget's semantic HTML structure using tools like HTML Validator or W3C Markup Validation Service.
