# Task ID: 14
# Title: Redesign and implement professional Connection Control Widget
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace the current poorly-designed Connection Control Widget with an enterprise-grade version featuring professional styling, proper layout, and consistent design system implementation to address critical customer feedback. This task is assigned to the ui-developer role.
# Details:
1. Analyze current Connection Control Widget implementation and document all design flaws:
   - Poor visual hierarchy and layout issues
   - Inconsistent spacing and alignment
   - Unprofessional color usage and typography
   - Lack of proper interactive feedback

2. Review existing dashboard widget design patterns:
   - Study styling from IP Address Widget, DNS Info Widget, and System Status Widget
   - Extract common design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
   - Document the established design system patterns

3. Design new Connection Control Widget:
   - Create proper visual hierarchy with clear sections
   - Implement consistent spacing using CSS variables (--spacing-xs through --spacing-xl)
   - Use professional color palette matching other widgets
   - Apply proper typography with clear font sizes and weights
   - Design hover states, focus states, and active states for all interactive elements

4. Implement the redesigned widget:
   - Structure HTML with semantic elements and proper accessibility
   - Create modular CSS following BEM methodology
   - Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Add smooth transitions for state changes
   - Implement proper loading and error states

5. Interactive elements enhancement:
   - Style buttons with consistent padding, borders, and shadows
   - Add proper focus indicators for keyboard navigation
   - Implement subtle animations for user feedback
   - Ensure all controls have appropriate cursor styles

6. Integration and consistency:
   - Verify widget matches the visual weight of other dashboard components
   - Ensure consistent use of shadows, borders, and corner radius
   - Validate color contrast for accessibility
   - Test widget appearance in both light and dark themes if applicable

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual regression testing:
   - Take screenshots of the new widget alongside other dashboard widgets
   - Verify visual consistency in spacing, colors, and typography
   - Compare with design system specifications

2. Cross-browser testing:
   - Test widget appearance in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify responsive behavior at different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Check for any layout breaking or style inconsistencies

3. Accessibility testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tools (axe, WAVE)
   - Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
   - Verify proper focus indicators and ARIA labels
   - Test with screen readers

4. User interaction testing:
   - Verify all hover states display correctly
   - Test click/tap feedback on interactive elements
   - Ensure smooth transitions and animations
   - Check loading and error state displays

5. Performance testing:
   - Measure CSS file size impact
   - Check for any render blocking issues
   - Verify smooth animations (60fps)

6. User acceptance testing:
   - Conduct A/B comparison with stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on professional appearance
   - Verify the design addresses all customer concerns
   - Document before/after screenshots for validation
