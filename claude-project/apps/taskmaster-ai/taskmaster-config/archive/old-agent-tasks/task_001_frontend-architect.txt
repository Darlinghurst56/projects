# Title: Architectural Framework for Agent-Registry Widget with Live Data Connection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6 (Not found), 7 (Not found), 8 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the architectural framework for the agent-registry widget, focusing on establishing a live data connection and enabling real-time updates within the agent management interface.
# Details:
1.  Define the data flow architecture for the agent-registry widget, including data sources, data transformation pipelines, and data sinks.
2.  Implement a WebSocket-based communication channel for real-time data updates from the backend to the frontend.
3.  Design the data model for representing agent information, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
4.  Integrate the agent-registry widget with the existing agent management interface, ensuring seamless user experience.
5.  Implement error handling and logging mechanisms for monitoring data flow and identifying potential issues.
6.  Consider implementing a caching mechanism to reduce the load on the backend and improve performance.
7.  Ensure the architecture is scalable and maintainable, allowing for future expansion and modifications.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the agent-registry widget displays live data from the backend.
2.  Simulate agent status changes on the backend and verify that the widget updates in real-time.
3.  Test the error handling mechanisms by simulating data connection failures and verifying that appropriate error messages are displayed.
4.  Measure the performance of the widget under different load conditions and ensure that it meets the performance requirements.
5.  Verify that the widget integrates seamlessly with the existing agent management interface.
6.  Test the caching mechanism by monitoring the number of requests to the backend and verifying that the cache is being used effectively.
7.  Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure that the widget meets the needs of the users.
