# Title: Create Design System MCP for Consistent UI Component Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a Design System MCP (Minimum Complete Product) to establish a consistent UI component library for the single home user dashboard, focusing on standardized components and design patterns.
# Details:
1.  Identify and document existing UI components and design patterns used in the single home user dashboard.
2.  Define a set of core UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, navigation elements, data displays) to be included in the design system, prioritizing reusability and accessibility.
3.  Develop standardized design patterns for common user interactions and workflows within the dashboard.
4.  Create a component library using a suitable technology (e.g., Storybook, React Styleguidist) to showcase and document the design system components and patterns.
5.  Implement a theming system to allow for customization and branding of the UI components.
6.  Document the design system, including usage guidelines, accessibility considerations, and code examples.
7.  Integrate the design system into the existing development workflow and provide training to developers on its usage.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that all core UI components are implemented according to the defined design specifications and accessibility guidelines.
2.  Ensure that the component library accurately showcases the components and provides clear usage documentation.
3.  Test the theming system to ensure that it allows for customization and branding of the UI components without breaking the design.
4.  Validate that the design system is integrated into the development workflow and that developers are using it correctly.
5.  Run accessibility tests on the design system components to ensure WCAG compliance.
6.  Check the visual consistency of the UI components across different browsers and devices.
