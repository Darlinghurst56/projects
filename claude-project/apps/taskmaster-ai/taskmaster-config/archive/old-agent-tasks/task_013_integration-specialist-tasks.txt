# Task ID: 13
# Title: Fix all non-functional buttons in dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement proper event handlers for all placeholder buttons in the dashboard including refresh buttons, settings buttons, and widget controls to restore full user interaction functionality.
# Details:
This task addresses a critical customer feedback issue where multiple buttons throughout the dashboard are non-functional placeholders. Implementation steps:

1. **Top Navigation Buttons**
   - Implement 'Refresh All' button handler to trigger data refresh for all widgets
   - Implement 'Settings' button handler to open global settings modal/panel
   - Add loading states and user feedback during operations

2. **Individual Widget Controls**
   - Add refresh button handlers for each widget type (DNS, SSL, Domain Info, etc.)
   - Implement widget-specific settings buttons to open configuration dialogs
   - Ensure each widget refresh only updates its own data without affecting others

3. **Event Handler Architecture**
   - Create a centralized event management system for button actions
   - Implement proper error handling and user notifications
   - Add visual feedback (loading spinners, disabled states, success indicators)

4. **User Feedback Implementation**
   - Show loading indicators during data refresh operations
   - Display success/error messages using toast notifications or inline alerts
   - Implement button disabled states during operations to prevent multiple clicks

5. **Integration Points**
   - Connect refresh buttons to existing data fetching logic
   - Wire settings buttons to configuration management system
   - Ensure proper state management for UI updates

6. **Accessibility Considerations**
   - Add proper ARIA labels and states for screen readers
   - Implement keyboard navigation support
   - Ensure focus management after button interactions

# Test Strategy:
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Click 'Refresh All' button and verify all widgets show loading states and update their data
   - Click individual widget refresh buttons and confirm only that widget updates
   - Click 'Settings' button and verify settings panel/modal opens correctly
   - Click individual widget settings and verify widget-specific configuration opens

2. **User Feedback Testing**
   - Verify loading indicators appear during refresh operations
   - Confirm success messages display after successful operations
   - Test error handling by simulating failed API calls
   - Ensure buttons are disabled during operations to prevent double-clicks

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify refresh operations connect to actual data sources
   - Confirm settings changes persist and apply correctly
   - Test that multiple simultaneous button clicks are handled properly

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Use keyboard navigation to activate all buttons
   - Test with screen reader to ensure proper announcements
   - Verify focus management after button interactions

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Ensure button responses are immediate (< 100ms feedback)
   - Verify no memory leaks from event handlers
   - Test with rapid successive clicks to ensure stability
