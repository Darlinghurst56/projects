# Task ID: 10
# Title: Test Multi-Agent Coordination with Priority and Conflict Resolution
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing for multi-agent coordination, ensuring proper priority handling and conflict resolution across all agent roles within the system.

PROJECT: House AI - Family Home Page | SUBPROJECT: Quality Assurance System
# Details:
1.  **Define Agent Roles and Interactions:** Clearly define all agent roles within the system and their expected interactions, including communication protocols and data exchange formats.
2.  **Develop Test Scenarios:** Create a comprehensive set of test scenarios that cover various multi-agent coordination scenarios, including:
    *   Priority Handling: Test cases where agents with different priorities compete for resources or tasks.
    *   Conflict Resolution: Test cases where agents have conflicting goals or actions, requiring resolution mechanisms.
    *   Resource Allocation: Test cases involving the allocation of shared resources among agents.
    *   Communication Protocols: Test cases to verify the reliability and efficiency of inter-agent communication.
    *   Error Handling: Test cases to simulate failures and ensure agents can recover gracefully.
3.  **Implement Test Automation:** Develop automated test scripts using a suitable testing framework (e.g., JUnit, pytest) to execute the defined test scenarios.
4.  **Simulate Agent Environments:** Create simulated environments that mimic real-world conditions and allow for controlled testing of agent interactions.
5.  **Monitor Agent Behavior:** Implement monitoring tools to track agent behavior during testing, including resource usage, communication patterns, and decision-making processes.
6.  **Analyze Test Results:** Analyze test results to identify any issues or bottlenecks in the multi-agent coordination system. Document findings and recommendations for improvement.
7.  **Implement Conflict Resolution Strategies:** Implement and test various conflict resolution strategies, such as negotiation, arbitration, or pre-defined rules, to ensure agents can resolve conflicts effectively.
8.  **Priority Handling Mechanisms:** Implement and test priority handling mechanisms to ensure that agents with higher priorities are given preferential treatment when competing for resources or tasks.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Scenario-Based Testing:** Execute each defined test scenario and verify that agents behave as expected, including proper priority handling and conflict resolution.
2.  **Performance Testing:** Measure the performance of the multi-agent coordination system under various load conditions, including response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
3.  **Stress Testing:** Subject the system to extreme conditions, such as high agent density or resource scarcity, to identify potential weaknesses and failure points.
4.  **Fault Injection Testing:** Simulate failures in agent communication or resource availability to verify that the system can handle errors gracefully.
5.  **Scalability Testing:** Evaluate the scalability of the system by increasing the number of agents and resources and measuring the impact on performance.
6.  **Integration Testing:** Test the integration of the multi-agent coordination system with other components of the overall system to ensure seamless interoperability.
7.  **Usability Testing:** Conduct usability testing with end-users to gather feedback on the ease of use and effectiveness of the multi-agent coordination system.
8.  **Security Testing:** Perform security testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the multi-agent coordination system.
