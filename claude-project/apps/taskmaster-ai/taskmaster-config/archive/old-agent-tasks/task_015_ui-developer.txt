# Task ID: 15
# Title: Human-Centered Dashboard UX Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fix frontend JavaScript errors and create intuitive, accessible agent dashboard interface that displays live autonomous agent data with real-time updates, modern design patterns, and human-centered interactions using MCP design tools and accessibility frameworks.
# Details:
1. **JavaScript Error Resolution:** Identify and fix all frontend JavaScript errors in the agent dashboard, including DOM manipulation issues, event handling problems, and asynchronous data loading failures. Use browser developer tools to systematically debug and resolve console errors.

2. **Live Agent Data Integration:** Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection to receive real-time updates from autonomous agents. Create a robust data synchronization layer that handles connection failures, reconnection logic, and data consistency.

3. **Modern Design System Implementation:** Use mcp__design-system__generate_component to create standardized UI components including agent cards, status indicators, task progress visualizations, and quick action buttons. Implement a cohesive color scheme with proper contrast ratios for accessibility.

4. **Accessible Interface Development:** Apply WCAG 2.1 AA standards throughout the dashboard. Use mcp__accessibility-testing__test_accessibility to validate keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and proper ARIA labeling. Ensure all interactive elements have proper focus indicators and semantic HTML structure.

5. **Human-Centered Interaction Patterns:** Design intuitive workflows for common tasks like viewing agent status, monitoring task progress, and intervening when needed. Implement clear visual feedback for all user actions, loading states, and error conditions. Add contextual help tooltips and progressive disclosure for complex information.

6. **Responsive Layout Architecture:** Create a flexible grid system that adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop viewports. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, ensuring content remains readable and interactive across all device sizes. Implement touch-friendly interaction zones for mobile users.

7. **Performance Optimization:** Implement efficient DOM updates using virtual DOM techniques or reactive frameworks. Add debouncing for frequent updates, lazy loading for non-critical components, and optimize asset delivery. Target sub-100ms response times for user interactions.

8. **Error Handling and Recovery:** Create graceful error states with clear messaging and recovery options. Implement automatic retry logic for failed data fetches, offline detection with appropriate UI states, and comprehensive error logging for debugging.

# Test Strategy:
1. **JavaScript Error Validation:** Run comprehensive browser testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Monitor console for any JavaScript errors during page load, user interactions, and data updates. Use automated error tracking tools to catch runtime exceptions.

2. **Real-Time Data Testing:** Verify WebSocket/SSE connections maintain stable connections over extended periods. Test data synchronization accuracy by comparing dashboard state with actual agent states. Simulate network interruptions to validate reconnection logic and data recovery.

3. **Accessibility Compliance:** Use mcp__accessibility-testing__test_family_dashboard_accessibility with 'wcag-aa' test type to validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Test keyboard navigation flow with Tab, Arrow keys, and Enter. Verify screen reader announcements for dynamic content updates using NVDA and JAWS.

4. **Cross-Device Responsiveness:** Test dashboard on various devices including iPhone 12/13, iPad, Android phones/tablets, and desktop monitors (1080p, 1440p, 4K). Verify touch interactions work smoothly on mobile devices and that all content remains accessible without horizontal scrolling.

5. **User Experience Validation:** Use mcp__user-testing__validate_user_experience with different user types (new-user, experienced-user, mobile-user) to assess usability. Measure task completion times for common workflows like checking agent status and reviewing completed tasks.

6. **Performance Benchmarking:** Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to measure initial load time (target < 3s), Time to Interactive (TTI < 5s), and First Contentful Paint (FCP < 1.5s). Monitor memory usage during extended sessions to detect memory leaks.

7. **Design Consistency Verification:** Use mcp__design-system__validate_design_consistency to ensure all UI components follow the established design system. Verify color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards using automated tools.

8. **Error Scenario Testing:** Deliberately trigger various error conditions (network failures, invalid data, server errors) and verify appropriate error messages display with recovery options. Test that the dashboard remains functional in degraded states.
