4.  Implement connection diagnostics functionality to perform tests and display results.
5.  Style the widget to match the existing dashboard theme and ensure a professional look and feel.
6.  Implement error handling and user feedback mechanisms for connection issues.
7.  Ensure the widget is responsive and works correctly on different screen sizes.
8.  Use appropriate libraries and APIs for DNS connection testing and filtering control.
9.  Consider using websockets for real-time updates.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the widget displays the correct DNS connection status.
2.  Test the toggle controls to ensure that DNS filtering can be paused and resumed.
3.  Run connection diagnostics and verify that the results are displayed accurately.
4.  Test the widget on different browsers and devices to ensure responsiveness.
5.  Simulate connection issues and verify that the widget displays appropriate error messages.
6.  Check that the widget integrates seamlessly with the rest of the dashboard.
7.  Validate that the styling is consistent with other dashboard widgets.
8.  Test the widget with different DNS configurations to ensure compatibility.
