## 💡 **Key Implementation Insights**

### **1. Start with TaskMaster Integration**
Your frontend agent should **enhance** your existing TaskMaster workflow:
```javascript
// frontend-coordinator.js
const taskmaster = require('./taskmaster-api-server.js');
const designSystem = require('mcp__design-system__*');
const accessibility = require('mcp__accessibility__*');

class FrontendAgent {
  async optimizeUserExperience(componentRequest) {
    // Leverage existing TaskMaster coordination
    const taskContext = await taskmaster.getCurrentContext();
    // Check design system compliance
    const designCheck = await designSystem.validateComponent(component);
    // Run accessibility scan
    const a11yResults = await accessibility.scanComponent(component);
    // Generate UX improvement suggestions
    return this.generateUXSuggestions(designCheck, a11yResults);
  }
}
```

### **2. Leverage Your Live System**
Since TaskMaster is **already running with 13 agents and 132 tasks**, your Frontend Agent becomes the **14th agent** that:
- Monitors design system consistency across all frontend tasks
- Provides real-time accessibility feedback to other agents
- Suggests UX improvements based on actual task completion patterns
- Ensures human-centered design principles in all UI work

### **3. Commercial Tool Integration**
```yaml
immediate_integrations:
  figma: "Design system integration via Figma API"
  lighthouse: "Performance and accessibility auditing"
  hotjar: "User behavior analytics integration"
  storybook: "Component documentation and testing"
```
