# TaskMaster AI Archive

This directory contains archived files from the development and evolution of TaskMaster AI. Files are organized by category and preserved for historical reference.

## Directory Structure

### `/documentation/`
**Purpose**: Historical documentation and analysis reports  
**Contents**: Legacy guides, MVP analyses, setup documentation, test reports  
**Preserved because**: Contains development history and alternative approaches that may be valuable for future reference

### `/experimental/`
**Purpose**: Experimental features and proof-of-concept code  
**Contents**: Docker configurations, LiteLLM setup, experimental dashboards, guided tours  
**Preserved because**: Contains working prototypes that demonstrate alternative implementation approaches

### `/legacy-api/`
**Purpose**: Deprecated API implementations and test files  
**Contents**: Old API test files, ESM/CommonJS conversion tests  
**Preserved because**: Historical record of API evolution and migration patterns

### `/legacy-tests/`
**Purpose**: Superseded test files and test output logs  
**Contents**: Old E2E tests, manual tests, test output files  
**Preserved because**: Documents testing evolution and contains test patterns that may be reused

### `/utilities/`
**Purpose**: Utility scripts and helper functions  
**Contents**: API integration examples, configuration utilities, validation scripts  
**Preserved because**: Contains reusable utility functions and integration patterns

### `/analysis/`
**Purpose**: Task analysis and execution scripts  
**Contents**: Specific task execution scripts, analysis tools  
**Preserved because**: Documents specific implementation approaches for complex tasks

## Archive Policy

**What gets archived:**
- Code that has been superseded but demonstrates working patterns
- Documentation that captures historical decision-making
- Experimental features that may be revisited
- Test files that document evolution of testing strategies

**What gets deleted:**
- Truly temporary files (logs, cache files)
- Duplicate files with no unique content
- Files with security risks or hardcoded credentials
- Generated files that can be recreated

## Usage Guidelines

**For developers:**
- Check archived documentation for context on design decisions
- Reference experimental code for alternative implementation approaches
- Use archived tests to understand evolution of testing strategies

**For maintenance:**
- Archive is preserved but not actively maintained
- Files may reference obsolete dependencies or configurations
- Use archived code as reference only, not for direct integration
