# E2E Test Output - TaskMaster AI Agent Coordination System

## Test Execution Report
- **Task ID:** 25
- **Agent:** backend-agent (via coordination system)
- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-15T16:32:00.000Z
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETED

## Test Results Summary

### 1. âœ… API Integration Fix
- **Issue:** Task assignment failed due to agent registration race condition
- **Fix:** Auto-registration logic implemented in HumanApprovalAPI
- **Result:** Agents are now automatically registered when suggestions are approved

### 2. âœ… AI Response Sanitization
- **Issue:** JSON parsing errors with double braces in AI responses
- **Fix:** Added sanitization method to TaskUpdateWrapper
- **Result:** AI responses are cleaned before processing

### 3. âœ… Route Hot-reload
- **Issue:** Dashboard required server restart for new routes
- **Fix:** Added dynamic route loading with `/api/admin/reload-routes` endpoint
- **Result:** Routes can be reloaded without server restart

### 4. âœ… Agent Coordination Enhancement
- **Issue:** Simple agent manager lacked coordination capabilities
- **Fix:** Integrated coordination workflow and task update wrapper
- **Result:** Agents can now execute tasks with full coordination

### 5. âœ… Human Approval Workflow
- **Test:** Created suggestion, approved via API, task assigned successfully
- **Result:** Full approval workflow functional with auto-registration

## System Status Verification
