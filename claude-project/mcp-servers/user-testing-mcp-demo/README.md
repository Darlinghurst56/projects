  }
}
```

### Direct Testing

```javascript
import { UserTestingMCPDemo } from './index.js';

const mcp = new UserTestingMCPDemo();

// Test family dashboard navigation
const navigation = await mcp.testDashboardNavigation('http://localhost:8000/family-dashboard');

// Validate TaskMaster integration
const integration = await mcp.validateTaskmasterIntegration('http://localhost:3001/taskmaster-api');

// Generate comprehensive test report
const report = await mcp.generateTestReport(['navigation', 'integration', 'family-workflows']);
```
