# Project Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Cleanup Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Executed comprehensive cleanup of the home-dashboard project to create a clean, organized, and maintainable structure following CLAUDE.md guidelines for minimal essential documentation.

## Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. ✅ Archive Structure Created

**Created directories:**
- `/archive/docs/` - Historical documentation
- `/archive/tests/` - Legacy test files
- `/archive/screenshots/` - Development screenshots  
- `/archive/deployment/` - Deployment artifacts
- `/archive/config/` - Legacy configuration files

### 2. ✅ Documentation Consolidation

**Moved to archive (25+ files):**
- All historical status reports
- All testing completion reports  
- All technical audit reports
- Installation and testing guides
- Service setup guides
- Performance optimization guides
- Troubleshooting documentation

**Retained essential docs:**
- `README.md` - Enhanced with Quick Start section
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Family-friendly reference
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API reference
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific information
- `RECONSTRUCTED_PRD.md` - Product requirements
- `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` - Architecture overview

### 3. ✅ New Documentation Structure

**Created `/docs/` directory with consolidated content:**
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Complete installation guide
- `TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation
- `EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md` - Service integration guide
- `PERFORMANCE.md` - Performance optimization guide
- `README.md` - Documentation navigation guide

### 4. ✅ Test File Organization

**Moved redundant test files to archive:**
- Development debug scripts (25+ files)
- Legacy performance tests
- Screenshot utilities
- Widget validation scripts
- Layout testing tools

**Organized active test structure:**
- Enhanced `tests/integration/` with key integration tests
- Preserved `tests/e2e/` for end-to-end scenarios
- Maintained `tests/unit/` for unit tests
- Kept `tests/accessibility/` for a11y testing

**Retained critical test files in root:**
- `quick-dashboard-check.js` - Quick health check
- `test-api-health.js` - API health monitoring

### 5. ✅ Asset Management

**Moved to archive:**
- Development screenshots (8 files)
- Deployment artifacts (tar.gz files)
- Log files and PID files
- Legacy configuration files

### 6. ✅ Reference Updates

**Updated broken references:**
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Updated FAMILY_GUIDE.md path to archive
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation paths
- Documentation cross-references now point to correct locations
